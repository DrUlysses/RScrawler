RScrawler

To run: 
- Change path_to_logs in analyzer/main.py
- Change PATH_TO_BDBOOT in crawler.h
- Modify venv (Sometimes it is needed to delete venv, insert new one and install packages from requirements.txt, but it can be enough to change all the python links in venv/bin)

(send missing steps, if I have forgot something to ananeviwan@gmail.com)
