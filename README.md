RScrawler

To run: 
- Modify venv (Sometimes it is needed to delete venv, insert new one and install packages from requirements.txt, but it can be enough to change all the python links in venv/bin)
- If your build folder is different from cmake-build-debug or is located somewhere outside the source folder - change main.py paths and other locations (Like main.cpp or crawler.h etc.)
